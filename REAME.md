# BOX18 Naija — Homepage Prototype (Next.js)

This is a presentation-ready homepage prototype for **BOX18 Naija**, built to demonstrate a premium editorial direction:
**African football as culture infrastructure** — beyond match results.

## What this prototype shows
- Premium editorial hierarchy (Hero → Focus Feature → Story Grid → Culture Engine → Video)
- A scalable component system (sections, cards, modules)
- Brand design system (colors + fonts + spacing)
- Dark mode toggle (demo-friendly)
- SEO-ready metadata + JSON-LD structure (homepage)

## Brand design choices (quick explanation)
- **Typography**
    - Headings: **Sora** (modern, confident editorial tone)
    - Body: **Inter** (high readability for long-form content)
- **Color**
    - Calm base for readability + premium feel
    - Two signature accents to create uniqueness (used sparingly)
    - Apple-style ambient gradients and subtle glass UI for a modern finish
